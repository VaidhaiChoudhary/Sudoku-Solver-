Successfully solves a classical 9x9 sudoku in an efficient way using Backtracking.

**Problem Statement**
To place a number into every empty box so that each row across, each 
column down, and each small 9-box square within the large square (there 
are 9 of these) will contain each number from 1 through 9. Remembering 
that no number may appear more than once in a row across, any column 
down, or within any small 9-box square. The numbers will be filled with the 
help of pattern matching.
